# Deep-Learning-Breast-US-Images-Segmentation

This repository contains the archives created for a project of the subject of Medical Imaging of the master in Telecommunications Engineering. 
The project consists of using Deep Learning to segment benign tumors in breast ultrasound images. For the segmentation we will use an encoder-decoder type neural network, known as U-Net. In turn, we will calculate the confusion matrix to know how many pixels we segment correctly. The database is available at:
